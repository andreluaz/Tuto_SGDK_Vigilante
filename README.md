## how to compile the demo
In the IDE of your choice (i use Visual Studio Code), type the following command in the terminal :

[sgdk_install_folder]\bin\make -f [sgdk_install_folder]\makefile.gen clean


Then


[sgdk_install_folder]\bin\make -f [sgdk_install_folder]\makefile.gen

where [sgdk_install_folder] is your SGDK install folder.

## exemple :

If your SGDK folder is "C:\sgdk", then the commands are :

C:\sgdk\bin\make -f C:\sgdk\makefile.gen clean

and

C:\sgdk\bin\make -f C:\sgdk\makefile.gen

The compiled rom will be in the "out" folder.


Enjoy !
